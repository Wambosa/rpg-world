/**
 * The player class
 * A simple class to maintain state of a player on screen,
 * as well as to draw that state when required.
 * @class
 * @property {Point} pos - the x y coordinates of the player
 * @property {Rect} size - used for calculating collisions (likely replace with phaser object)
 * @property {string} state - seems to just be used to show the player if the other one is connected
 * @property {Color} color - one of the dimensions of change. The player can change colors and notify the other player that it has changed
 * @property {Color} infoColor - a local color that is seen when text is rendered over the player
 * @property {Vector2[]} inputs - todo: i think this is an array of vector2 that signify what buttons were pressed
 * 
 * @property {socketio.connection} socketClient - set by the serverSide game and used to send updates to clients
 * 
 * @summary contains the state for player cubes
